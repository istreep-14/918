Project Goal using archives. 

Core game ingestion (official, stable)
  Archives list: https://api.chess.com/pub/player/{username}/games/archives
    Use once to discover all {YYYY}/{MM} URLs for full backfill.
Monthly archive: https://api.chess.com/pub/player/{username}/games/{YYYY}/{MM}
    Primary source for every gameâ€™s canonical metadata and PGN. Parse PGN headers for ECO/Openings, termination, etc.

Profile & stats snapshots (official, stable)
  Profile: https://api.chess.com/pub/player/{username}
    Used initially for general profile logging establishing who the "player" is that the sheet is referring too. this one is not a snapshot based, running this api will just replace profile info from before
  Stats: https://api.chess.com/pub/player/{username}/stats
    Use for point-in-time rating, wins/losses/draws by time class, best scores, etc. this one will append new data of player stats

Game details by ID (unofficial, subject to change)
  Game callback:
    Live: https://www.chess.com/callback/live/game/{id}
    Daily: https://www.chess.com/callback/daily/game/{id}
      Used for pulling more data per game not available in archives, ran seperately than backfill as it runs one website per game and will act far slower, (used for exact rating change per game)
